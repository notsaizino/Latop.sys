## latop.sys â€” Windows Keyboard Latency Optimizer

**Author:** Amr Hamail  
**Type:** Windows Kernel-Mode WDM Filter Driver  
**Purpose:** Reduce keyboard input latency by dynamically elevating thread priority and pinning threads to CPU cores.  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## âš¡ Overview

**latop.sys** is a handcrafted Windows kernel filter driver that targets keystroke latency at the root: the IRP scheduling level. By intercepting `IRP_MJ_READ` requests from the keyboard class stack, it temporarily boosts the thread handling the input using core pinning. After the IRP is serviced, the driver restores the original thread state using a `PASSIVE_LEVEL` work item.

This design reduces context switching and improves input dispatch latencyâ€”critical in applications such as real-time control, gaming, and embedded systems development.

## ðŸ§  Technical Highlights

- **Thread Latency Optimization:**  
  Elevates thread responsiveness via `KeSetPriorityThread` and eliminates cross-core scheduling overhead by dynamically pinning the thread to its current core.
KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx(affinityMask);

- **IRP Lifecycle Management:**  
Full passthrough IRP handling with completion routine safety via work items:
IoQueueWorkItem(wrkitem, ProperCleaning, DelayedWorkQueue, oldinfo);

- **Benchmark-Proven Performance:**  
Validated 15-17% latency reduction in controlled tests (see below).

### Key Findings
- **Old Hardware:**  
  - 29â€“34% latency reduction
  - Priority boosting yielded ~22% effective clockâ€‘speed gain  
- **New Hardware:**  
  - ~15â€“18% latency reduction; 
  - Driver kept CPU ~7 Â°C cooler under load, avoiding thermal throttling

## âš  Limitations

- Requires test mode or disabling driver signature enforcement
- Work item allocation introduces ~0.4Âµs overhead per IRP
- Only tested in VM so far
- **Performance results are simulated** - real-world benchmarking needed for validation

---

## ðŸ”§ Build & Installation
Unbuildable due to .ini issues.

## ðŸ™‡ Authorâ€™s Note

This is my first driver ever, so I had no idea how to run it or test it. It was very hard. But, I made it through! :D ðŸŽ‡
