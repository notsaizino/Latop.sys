# latop.sys ‚Äì Latency Optimized Keyboard Driver

Author's note: This Driver is currently untested. Use at your own risk. 

## üß† Overview

**`latop.sys`** is a Windows kernel-mode filter driver designed to reduce input latency from the keyboard by intervening in the IRP's (I/O Request Packet) processing path. It does this with a combination of **thread priority boosting** and **CPU affinity pinning**, which minimizes **Context Switches**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

### ‚û§ Device Stack Filtering

The driver attaches itself to the **keyboard class driver** as a **filter device**. It does not replace or disable any default behavior‚Äîit merely intercepts `IRP_MJ_READ` requests meant for the keyboard, applies low-latency optimizations, and then passes them down the stack untouched.

- `DeviceAttach()` creates a filter device and attaches it to the keyboard stack using `IoAttachDeviceToDeviceStackSafe`.
- The `DEVICE_EXTENSION` structure stores the pointer to the next device below us (`LowerDeviceObject`) so we can forward IRPs properly.

### ‚û§ IRP Handling & Optimization

The core optimization happens in `ReadKeyboardInput()`:

1. **Boosts thread priority** with `KeSetPriorityThread` (to `HIGH_PRIORITY`).
2. **Pins the thread to CPU 0** using `KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx`, to reduce context switching.
3. **Stores old state** (thread priority and core affinity) in a custom context structure (`MY_COMPLETION_CONTEXT`).
4. **Sets a Completion Routine** to restore the thread's original priority, to remove the affinity pin, and to free the allocated pool for `MY_COMPLETION_CONTEXT`.

The IRP then continues down the device stack. This is **non-invasive**‚Äîthe keyboard still works normally, just with faster dispatch latency.

### ‚û§ Completion Routine

`CompletionRoutine()` restores the original thread priority and CPU affinity. It also logs its execution using `KdPrint`.

This routine does **not** alter the IRP data. It‚Äôs only concerned with thread-level control.

## üßπ Clean Unload

The `latopUnload()` routine:

- Detaches the filter(s) from the device stack via `IoDetachDevice`.
- Deletes all filter device objects with `IoDeleteDevice`.

The loop ensures that **all device objects created by this driver** are cleaned up, even if more than one exists. Currently, no symbolic link is implemented (planned for phase 2).

## üõë IRP Routing

- `IRP_MJ_CREATE` and `IRP_MJ_CLOSE` are simply passed through.
- `IRP_MJ_READ` is where latency optimization happens.
- All other IRPs are currently unsupported and are not intercepted or altered.

---

## üîê Safety & Stability

- Thread modifications are restored *immediately* in the completion routine.
- No memory leaks‚Äî`ExAllocatePoolWithTag` always has a matching `ExFreePoolWithTag`.
- `IoSetCompletionRoutine` ensures restoration logic runs *even on IRP failure*.
- Logging is handled via `KdPrint` for debugging and visibility.

## üìå Notes for the Future

Planned improvements:

- Add a **symbolic link interface** for optional user-mode interaction.
- Explore:
  - DMA strategies for batching input IRPs
  - Real-time input logging and timestamp analysis
  - Kernel bypass optimizations
- Possibly integrate registry configuration for tuning affinity/priority.

## üîß Build & Deployment

This driver is built for **Windows 10+** using the **Windows Driver Kit (WDK)**.
