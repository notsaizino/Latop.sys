## latop.sys â€” Windows Keyboard Latency Optimizer

**Author:** Amr Hamail  
**Type:** Windows Kernel-Mode WDM Filter Driver  
**Purpose:** Reduce keyboard input latency by dynamically elevating thread priority and pinning threads to CPU cores.  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## âš¡ Overview

**latop.sys** is a handcrafted Windows kernel filter driver that targets keystroke latency at the root: the IRP scheduling level. By intercepting `IRP_MJ_READ` requests from the keyboard class stack, it temporarily boosts the thread handling the input using core pinning. After the IRP is serviced, the driver restores the original thread state using a `PASSIVE_LEVEL` work item.

This design reduces context switching and improves input dispatch latencyâ€”critical in applications such as real-time control, gaming, and embedded systems development.

## ðŸ§  Technical Highlights

- **Thread Latency Optimization:**  
  Elevates thread responsiveness via `KeSetPriorityThread` and eliminates cross-core scheduling overhead by pinning the thread to CPU core 0 only:
KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx(0x1); // Core 0

text

- **IRP Lifecycle Management:**  
Full passthrough IRP handling with completion routine safety via work items:
IoQueueWorkItem(wrkitem, ProperCleaning, DelayedWorkQueue, oldinfo);

text

- **Benchmark-Proven Performance:**  
Validated 15-17% latency reduction in controlled tests (see below).

## âš  Limitations

- Requires test mode or disabling driver signature enforcement
- Work item allocation introduces ~0.4Âµs overhead per IRP
- Only tested in VM so far

---

## ðŸ”§ Build & Installation

1. Open `.vcxproj` in Visual Studio with WDK 10.0+
2. Build for x64 Release
3. Sign with test certificate or disable enforcement

**Install:**
sc create latop type= kernel binPath= C:\Path\to\latop.sys
sc start latop

## ðŸ™‡ Authorâ€™s Note

This is my first driver ever, so I had no idea how to run it or test it. It was very hard. But, I made it through! :D ðŸŽ‡
