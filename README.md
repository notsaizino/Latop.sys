# latop.sys ‚Äî Windows Keyboard Latency Optimizer

**Author:** [Amr Hamail]  
**Type:** Windows Kernel-Mode WDM Filter Driver  
**Purpose:** Reduce keyboard input latency by dynamically elevating thread priority and pinning threads to specific CPU cores.  
**Status:** Active Development

## ‚ö° Overview

`latop.sys` is a handcrafted Windows kernel filter driver designed to reduce input lag at the system level. It intercepts keyboard read IRPs and temporarily boosts the processing thread‚Äôs priority while pinning it to a single CPU core ‚Äî reducing context switching and speeding up IRP completion.

Built entirely on the Windows Driver Model (WDM), `latop.sys` provides complete control over IRP propagation, thread scheduling, and low-level latency behavior.

Every design decision ‚Äî from how memory is allocated to how the IRP stack is copied ‚Äî was made deliberately, from scratch, to achieve minimal input-to-response delay.

## üß† Technical Highlights

- **Thread Latency Optimization**  
  Uses `\texttt{KeSetPriorityThread}` to boost IRQL-handling threads to high priority and `\texttt{KeSetSystemAffinityThreadEx}` to lock them to a CPU core during IRP servicing.

- **IRP Lifecycle Management**  
  Intercepts and propagates IRPs using `\texttt{IoCopyCurrentIrpStackLocationToNext}`, `\texttt{IoCallDriver}`, and stack-aware completion via `\texttt{IoSetCompletionRoutine}`.

- **Safe Context Handling**  
  Allocates thread-state data in non-paged memory (priority, affinity, thread object) and safely restores it post-completion, even during edge-case interruptions.

- **Stack Integrity & Modularity**  
  Designed as a class filter driver with full support for passthrough logic, stack-safe detachment, and minimal disruption to device behavior.

## üöß Limitations

- **No symbolic link or user-mode interface** ‚Äî all logic operates purely at kernel level.
- **Currently supports only keyboard class stack (kbdclass.sys)** ‚Äî future HID/USB-level support planned.
- **Test environments only** ‚Äî use in production environments may lead to instability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions

1. Open in Visual Studio with WDK installed.
2. Build in **x64 Release** mode.
3. Load using test-signing or via tools like OSR Loader.

## üî≠ Future Enhancements

- IRP batching and coalescing to further reduce latency bursts
- URB-level optimization targeting USB polling delays
- Integration with `10xclick.sys` for full input stack acceleration.
- Plan to use 10xclick.sys as base to develop a driver for N-key rolling for USB keyboards. It is a forgotten feature of many PS/2 Keyboards.

## üôá A Word from the Author

This driver is the product of curiosity and love for Windows internals ‚Äî not corporate demand. I built this project line by line because I wanted to understand what happens *between* a keystroke and the software it reaches.
